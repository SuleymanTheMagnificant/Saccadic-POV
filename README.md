# Saccadic POV

Project to use the persistence of vision across saccades as a research tool.

Persistence of vision (POV): The continuance of a visual percept after it has stopped stimulating the retina. Closely related to the visual icon, a form of sensory memory that has a high capacity storage, but very brief duration. In this display, persistence of vision is induced via a rapidly flashing LED strip that shows successive vertical lines of a bitmap image. When eyes are moved past the display at the correct speed, the image is "painted" across the retina.

Saccade: A very rapid eye movement, approximately 20-200 milliseconds in duration. Saccades are planned and executed in a ballistic fashion (once a target it selected, it can't be modified after the eye movement starts) and can happen many times a second. We are often unaware that we can make saccades many times a second, in part because vision is suppressed during the saccade.

CURRENT GOALS:
1. Interface with Python and PsychoPy for experimental control
2. Measure actual rate of flashing LEDs and model the size of the image on the retina
