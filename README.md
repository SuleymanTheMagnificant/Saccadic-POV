# Saccadic POV

Project to use the persistence of vision across saccades as a research tool.

Persistence of vision (POV): What has come to be a popular term for light displays that take advantage of rapidly moving LEDs to create 2D images. The basic effect can be demonstrated in a number of different ways. It is probably due to depletion rates of photopigments in the retina.

CURRENT GOALS:
1. Interface with Python and PsychoPy for experimental control
2. Measure actual rate of flashing LEDs and model the size of the image on the retina
